# netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate

Provides a netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate resource. This can be used to create a new aggregate on Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
Requires existence of a Cloud Manager Connector and a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

## Example Usages

**Create netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate:**

```
resource "netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate" "cl-aggregate" {
  provider = netapp-cloudmanager
  name = "aggr2"
  working_environment_id = netapp-cloudmanager_cvo_gcp.cvo-gcp.id #
  client_id = netapp-cloudmanager_connector_gcp.cm-gcp.client_id #
  number_of_disks = 1
  provider_volume_type = "gp2"
}
```

**Create netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate with EBS Elastic Volumes support (AWS only):**

```
resource "netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate" "cl-aggregate-with-ev" {
  provider = netapp-cloudmanager
  name = "aggr_with_ev_support"
  working_environment_id = netapp-cloudmanager_cvo_aws.cvo-aws.id
  client_id = netapp-cloudmanager_connector_aws.cm-aws.client_id
  number_of_disks = 3
  provider_volume_type = "gp3"
  disk_size_size = 100
  disk_size_unit = "GB"
  
  # Enable EBS Elastic Volumes support (creation time only)
  initial_ev_aggregate_size = 500
  initial_ev_aggregate_unit = "GB"
}
```

**Update aggregate capacity using EBS Elastic Volumes (AWS only):**

```
resource "netapp-cloudmanager_aggregate" "cl-aggregate-with-capacity" {
  provider = netapp-cloudmanager
  name = "aggr_with_capacity"
  working_environment_id = netapp-cloudmanager_cvo_aws.cvo-aws.id
  client_id = netapp-cloudmanager_connector_aws.cm-aws.client_id
  number_of_disks = 2
  provider_volume_type = "gp3"
  disk_size_size = 100
  disk_size_unit = "GB"
  
  # EBS Elastic Volumes configuration (required for capacity increase)
  initial_ev_aggregate_size = 500
  initial_ev_aggregate_unit = "GB"
  
  # Increase aggregate capacity (update operation only)
  increase_capacity_size = 200
  increase_capacity_unit = "GB"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Arguments marked with “Forces new resource” will cause the resource to be recreated if their value is changed after creation.

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource) The name of the new aggregate.
* `working_environment_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The public ID of the working environment where the aggregate will be created. This argument is optional if working_environment_name is provided. You can find the ID from a previous create Cloud Volumes ONTAP action as shown in the example, or from the information page of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on [https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/](https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/).
* `working_environment_name` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The working environment name where the aggregate will be created. This argument will be ignored if working_environment_id is provided.
* `client_id` - (Required, Forces new resource) The client ID of the Cloud Manager Connector. You can find the ID from a previous create Connector action as shown in the example, or from the Connector tab on [https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/](https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/).
* `connector_ip` - (Optional) The IP of the connector, this is only required for 'Restricted' mode account.
* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The NetApp tenant ID that the Connector will be associated with. This is required for the Restricted deployment mode. You can find the tenant ID in the Identity & Access Management in Settings, Organization tab of BlueXP at [https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/](https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/).
* `deployment_mode` - (Optional) The mode of deployment to use for the working environment: ['Standard', 'Restricted']. The default is 'Standard'. To know more on deployment modes [https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-modes.html/](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-modes.html/)
* `number_of_disks` - (Optional) The required number of disks in the new aggregate.
* `disk_size_size` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The required size of the disks. The max number depends on the `provider_volume_type`. Details in this document: AWS: [https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes/reference-limits-aws.html#aggregate-limits] Azure: [https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes/reference-limits-azure.html#aggregate-limits] GCP: [https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes/reference-limits-gcp.html#disk-and-tiering-limits] **Note: Must be provided together with `disk_size_unit`**
* `disk_size_unit` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The disk size unit ['GB' or 'TB']. **Note: Must be provided together with `disk_size_size`**
* `home_node` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The home node that the new aggregate should belong to. The default is the first node.
* `provider_volume_type` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The cloud provider volume type. For AWS: ['gp3', 'gp2', 'io1', 'st1', 'sc1']. For Azure: ['Premium_LRS','Standard_LRS','StandardSSD_LRS']. For GCP: ['pd-balanced', 'pd-ssd','pd-standard']
* `capacity_tier` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The aggregate's capacity tier for tiering cold data to object storage: ['S3', 'Blob', 'cloudStorage']. The default values for each cloud provider are as follows: Amazon => 'S3', Azure => 'Blob', GCP => 'cloudStorage'. If NONE, the capacity tier won't be set on aggregate creation.
* `iops` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Provisioned IOPS. Needed only when 'providerVolumeType' is 'io1' or 'gp3'
* `throughput` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Required only when 'providerVolumeType' is 'gp3'.
* `initial_ev_aggregate_size` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Initial size for EBS Elastic Volumes aggregate (AWS only). This enables the aggregate to support capacity expansion using Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes. **Creation time only** - cannot be modified after aggregate creation. **Note: Must be provided together with `initial_ev_aggregate_unit`**
* `initial_ev_aggregate_unit` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Unit for initial EBS Elastic Volumes aggregate size (GB, TB, GiB, or TiB). Only used with `initial_ev_aggregate_size`. Defaults to 'GB' if not specified. **Creation time only** - cannot be modified after aggregate creation. **Note: Must be provided together with `initial_ev_aggregate_size`**
* `increase_capacity_size` - (Optional, Computed) Additional capacity to add to the aggregate using Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes. **Only supported for AWS aggregates with EBS Elastic Volumes enabled**. **Update operation only** - cannot be used during aggregate creation. The aggregate must be created with `initial_ev_aggregate_size` to support capacity increases. **Important:** After a successful capacity increase operation, remove the parameter from your configuration to prevent unnecessary state changes and achieve idempotency in subsequent Terraform runs. **Note: Must be provided together with `increase_capacity_unit`**
* `increase_capacity_unit` - (Optional, Computed) Unit for the additional capacity (Byte, KB, MB, GB, or TB). Only used with `increase_capacity_size`. **Update operation only** - cannot be used during aggregate creation. **Important:** After a successful capacity increase operation, remove the parameter from your configuration to prevent unnecessary state changes and achieve idempotency in subsequent Terraform runs. **Note: Must be provided together with `increase_capacity_size`**

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `id` - will be the aggregate name.
* `total_capacity_size` - The total capacity of the aggregate.
* `total_capacity_unit` - The unit of the total capacity.
* `available_capacity_size` - The available capacity of the aggregate.
* `available_capacity_unit` - The unit of the available capacity.
